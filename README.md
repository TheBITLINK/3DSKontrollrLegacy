# 3DSKontrollr
Control your Windows PC with a Nintendo 3DS console.

This Project is based on this one: https://github.com/jwarby/3ds-to-pc-controller
But the server is written on C#, has a nice UI and is designed for Windows. Also it has support for the B button.

##THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL ABANDONED PROJECT
If you want to download binaries for the latest stable version, go to https://d.thebit.link/3dsk

This project is licensed under MIT, so you can do anything you want with the code.

I'm currently working on a continuation for this project. There's no exact date, but it will support mobile phones and emulating Xbox controllers!
